# SecretCode
An adaptation of the "Secret Code" board game using Objected Oriented Programming.

The "Secret Code" game is a board game for two players. One player (P1) chooses a code comprised of four colours in a unique combination for
the other player (P2) to guess. P2 then has ten turns to guess the code, while being given hints along the way (full rules in game). 

I have implemented the guessing function of the game, but am now working on the asking functionality, where the player sets a code and the computer tries to guess it.
